                                A: A swab sample is taken from the nose & throat. Your sample is then submitted to a certified lab for examination. Your test results can be shared as early as 5 hours, depending on the chosen service and location.

                                A: Covid-19 tests can be uncomfortable but are not painful. Swab tests are done thoroughly yet gently using a cotton swab to penetrate the nose or throat; this can lead to slight discomfort & a gagging or coughing sensation.

                            <p>
                                A: A Covid-19 PCR test is used to detect the presence of infection with SARS-CoV2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 disease). This very sensitive test looks for the RNA of the virus using a technique called RT-PCR. The test can detect as little as one virus particle in swabs taken from inside the mouth or nose & is recognized as the most reliable test for Covid-19.

                                A: Yes, we can visit your home, hotel, or office to conduct a Covid-19 swab test. Our qualified nurses will come to your location, fully equipped with protective gear, to take your test swab at your convenient time. Your sample is then submitted to a certified lab for examination. Your test results will be shared with you within 5, 7, 12, or 24 hours depending upon the chosen service and location.

                            <p>
                                A: A Covid-19 PCR test will detect whether you currently have Covid-19. A Covid-19 antibody test will see whether you have had Covid-19 in the past & have recovered from it by checking the Covid-19 antibody level in your body.

                                A: If you test positive for Covid-19, you must self-isolate for 14 days. You may wish to consult with a doctor from the comfort of your home.

                                A: If the client is presumptive positive or the viral load is inconclusive in the first run, the lab must rerun the sample, which may delay the delivery of the reports. Justlife will not be accountable for any reimbursement in such situations. Reruns may require an additional 2 to 24 hours to complete. This procedure must be followed to ensure that the reports are accurate. The lab cannot provide false positive, false negative, or presumptive positive reports; instead, they must rerun the sample.
